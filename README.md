## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Tangle
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will:
   - Start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Launch the Electron application
   - Initialize the SQLite database (`tangle.db`)

### Development

- **React Development**: The React app runs on `http://localhost:3000` and supports hot reloading
- **Electron Development**: The Electron main process automatically restarts when `main.js` changes
- **Database**: SQLite database file (`tangle.db`) is created automatically on first run

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build React app for production
npm run build

# Package as Electron app
npm run package
```

## Architecture

Tangle follows a multi-process Electron architecture:

- **Main Process**: Node.js backend handling database operations and window management
- **Renderer Process**: React frontend providing the user interface
- **IPC Bridge**: Secure communication between frontend and backend via `preload.js`
- **SQLite Database**: Local storage for all notes, links, and metadata

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, CSS3
- **Backend**: Electron, Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Visualization**: Cytoscape.js
- **UI Libraries**: react-draggable, react-resizable
- **Build Tools**: React Scripts, Electron Builder
